    On the edge of the world stands the progressive town of Binaryville, where technology is a way of life. The robots
    who live, work, and play in
    Binaryville learn from an early age that magic is made simply by combining 0's and 1's. For the Binaryville robots,
    every waking thought and
    every sleeping dream is consumed with unique permutationsâ€¦and endless possibilities.
